evolution


Evolution of spore shape, stem length, seasonal fruiting to be better carried by wind. More spread means more different mating options.
Simulation?
Limited range of finding a mate, make trade-offs.
Mutation chance per individual, more individuals, more mutations. Reasonable cap to prevent exponential growth? Keep options sensible and limited.
Give preview of stats.
Mechanic to grow towards mate? Or just point and click? More preview information the closer you get? Death on exhaustion?

Traits:
Spore mass -> more nutrients = longer reach but lower dispersal and quantity
nutrient need PER BODY
mutation rate
crit rate (= no cost for mutation)
body size
body count (lol)
competitiveness
